I wanted to make a recipe based on some moon shine recipes I found. I imagined if the moon shiner wanted to give it a bit of a twist and added smoked malt. I think I want to try my hand at smoking my own malt with Jack Daniels Whiskey smoking chips (Made from used barrels). Also I might just change the flaked corn into malted corn.

It's coming close to Valentine's day and thought there's not enough Valentine's day themed beers. Necco Sweethearts are pretty much just sugar, with some extra ingredients that have shown head retention properties and flavoring. Santiam hops are said to have floral notes, so that goes along with the theme too! So you might want to only pick out the colors (flavors) you want to be tasted (If they didn't fade away really quick in the first place) in your beer. I would vote for pink (Strawberry) and/or chocolate.

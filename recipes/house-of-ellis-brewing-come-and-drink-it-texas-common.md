I call it a Texas Common. It uses Mesquite (A tree that is common in Texas, that is used for smoking meat) smoked malt, Sorghum (Which was Texas' first cash crop) and Rice syrup (There's a valley of wild rice in Texas, but it's very limit and hard to get ones hands onto), Grapefruit & spicy tasting hops and Mexican Lager Yeast. Since everything is bigger in Texas, it's a darker and slightly stronger beer.


Ferment like a Steam (~70 F).

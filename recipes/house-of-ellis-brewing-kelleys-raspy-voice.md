Raspberry and Cranberry Lider (Like Cider)


In memory of my wife Kelley (1978 - 2014). I never got to brew this before she died. She didn't like beer all that much, but she did like a Raspberry Wheat from the New Albanian Brewing Company. So I came up with this recipe a while back ago, based on what she liked. The name was inspired by her voice when she would get sick. It was like Joey's agent from Friends - Estelle Leonard.


Dried raspberries at 5 minutes.

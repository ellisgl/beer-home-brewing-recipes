The Mooselon was a punk hangout in Keller, TX from the early 90's to early 2000's. The word 'Mooselon' supposedly means "The breading ground of Moose". This beer was formulated to take you away to a field in a the middle of the woods, with floral, grassy and woody notes with a light hint of smoke.


No Moose spawning related tastes added, nor the stench of a hot Texas night filled with sweaty punks.


Dedicated to the Late Mark Christopher Shaw (1980 - 2012), the man that created The Mooselon.

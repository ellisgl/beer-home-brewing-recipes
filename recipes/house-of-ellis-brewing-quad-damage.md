Quake (the game) in Beer form.


3 week primary, 2 drops of Fermcap S at the beginning to help lessen the blow off. Use a blow off with this. 11 month bottle conditioning.


I would say brew on June 22, bottle after 3 weeks and open on June 22 of the next year.


Prime for 2.1 vol (0.69 ounces of dextrose @ 70 degrees if bottling)

Here's your damned coffee beer!


The day before the brew, spread out oats on cookie sheet, roast @ 300Â°F for ~30 minutes (Or till it smells like cookies). Move to another cookie sheet right after to help cool. Store in brown paper bag over night. Oats should be golden and smell like oatmeal cookies.


Mash: Add the 10 fl. oz. of brewed coffee to mash water. 


Bottling: 1 to 2 drops of organic maple extract per bottle.
